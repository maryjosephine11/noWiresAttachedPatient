# noWiresAttached Patient App Rough Prototype


### This repo is a rough SwiftUI prototype of the first two pages of the [patient app wireframe](https://www.figma.com/file/JfnYriXWhtl7GTEUmH9IeS/Wireframe--%3E-Upgrade?type=design&node-id=201-61&mode=design&t=fjMuSoRVTrvDVpSP-0).

In order to ease navigation between screens, this prototype implements [Mijick's Navigattie library](https://github.com/Mijick/Navigattie/tree/main).

Notes of importance while looking at this prototype:
- There are some "TO-DO:" notes in the code due to the rough nature of this prototype
- Since this is mainly a UI prototype, certain UX features are still in the works, such as:
    - random number generation for a patient's ID
    - the "forgot PIN" pathway
    - ability to use device location to help a new patient select their provider
