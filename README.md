# noWiresAttached Patient App Rough Prototype


### This repo is a rough SwiftUI prototype of the first two pages of the [patient app wireframe](https://www.figma.com/file/JfnYriXWhtl7GTEUmH9IeS/Wireframe--%3E-Upgrade?type=design&node-id=201-61&mode=design&t=fjMuSoRVTrvDVpSP-0).

In order to ease navigation between screens, this prototype implements [Mijick's Navigattie library](https://github.com/Mijick/Navigattie/tree/main).
